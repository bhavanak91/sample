<li id="books"> Books <ol> <li><b> In Search of Schrondinger's cat </b> <br> <p> Physics was one subject i was never good at during High school (not that i was great at any of the other subjects though but Physics was a nightmare). There were concepts which were totally ambiguous to me and went way above my head. This book not only clarified some of them but also instilled in me a deep interest in Physics.
In this book, John Gribbin gives a fabulous peek into the magical realm of quantum physics.

He begins with an explanation on the very basic unit of life - "the atom" and the various evolving attempts by scientists to give an accurate description of the structure of an atom (Including the various experiments leading to the discovery of protons, neutrons and electrons). He then explains the Planck's black body radiation and the famous two-slit experiment whose observations threw the entire scientific community into a state of utter ambiguity and disarray about the nature of electrons. Some more experiments later they discover the "photon" and the dual nature (particle and wave nature) of light and particles like electrons. This is followed by discoveries by Pauli (the Pauli exclusion principle), Heisenberg, Born and Schrondinger which strengthen the theory of quantum mechanics. A very interesting part of the book is on "time travel" which according to the author is possible (atleast theoretically) though it might have a lot of practical hurdles. He believes that parallel worlds do exist but not the way in which we imagine (in most of the sci-fiction books) where we can hop between the alternate universes but all the alternate universes according to quantum theory branch out based on the choices that the observer encounters. He also writes about the two different theories explaining the way things work in this universe - The "Copenhagen interpretation" where there are numerous possibilities of something happening but there is only one reality (in one world) and the rest are just virtual ghostly worlds which all collapse into one result when the observer actually observes the system. The "many-worlds interpretation" contradicts the Copenhagen interpretation in the sense it assumes all the possibilities to be equally real and exist in their own worlds with their own observers (us being one of them). All in all the entire quantum mechanics lies on the observer who observes the system. What happens when the observer is not looking is something that is not explained by the quantum theory (and can only be speculated). Finally, the search for Schrodinger's cat ends by the author using the many-worlds theory to testify the fact that the cat is in reality both dead and alive (in two separate, mutually exclusive worlds) but not either dead or alive. When the observer looks into the box, he forces one outcome , which is the cat is either dead or alive and the other possibility still exists in its own world with its own observer (which is as real as our universe). A very interesting theory but this is just the author's personal views i guess.

The author in the end also touches upon the theory of supersymmetry which is the latest field under study within the quantum community and deals with unifying matter (particles like electrons,protons, quarks etc) and force (the bosons like photons etc).

The entire book has been an amazing ride through the mindbogglingly unbelievable world of the sub-atomic particles and i cant say it better than Neils Bohr - "Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not fully understood it". </p> </li>
<li><b> In Search of Secret India </b> <br> <p> There are some moments in life when you fall short of words and all the language in the world does not suffice to describe how awe-inspiring and beautiful and exhilarating a state a book can leave you in. I was left in that state after reading this book.
During a short visit to Ramana Ashram at Arunachalam last year, i stumbled upon a small book (excerpts from this same book "A Search in Secret India") in the Ashram gallery, which was an account of a British traveler to India who came in search of a spiritual guru. I got back home and bought the full book. The author Paul Brunton is a British journalist and philosopher who has made an aim in life to tour various parts of the world and meet the holy saints and learn about the various spiritual teachings they had to offer. In this quest, he ends up touring India as well. He arrives in India when the country's freedom struggle was at its peak - the 1930's (Him being a British, I must also mention, I am amazed at his temerity to visit India during those times when the whites were not welcome at all). He meets several saints during his tour in India including a magician from Persia in Bombay, couple of yogis in Madras who have perfected the Yoga of Body and Mind control, Meher baba (whom he openly and blantantly criticizes), Lahari Mahasaya, Kanchi Paramacharya, Radha Soamis and many others but his quest ends when he meets Ramana maharishi at Arunachala. The deep inquisitiveness and scientific reasoning that he possesses (devoid of blind faith that the average Indian in those days and probably even today hold) makes his conversations with the saints truly intriguing. He asks very simple yet deep spiritual questions to them which connects with the reader (as most of us contemplate on such questions too). I must digress here and also mention that I felt truly proud of my country of housing such learned men with such in-depth spiritual experience who have conquered worldly desires, overcome vices and are at absolute peace with themselves. There is so much to learn in this country. This book also serves as a travelogue in the 1930's India and the way people lived in those days.
Reading about these saints, their out-of-the world experiences and their spiritual teachings itself is such an awe-inducing thing but there is something even more wonderful than that - Looking back at all the little events that have happened to the author during his trip to India, they all seemed to have happened to align with something that has been pre-ordained for the author i.e they have all collectively enabled the author to continue in his quest to reach out to the learned men and find his true calling. He has never heard of the Mahasaya but he ends up meeting a fellow passenger on a train to Calcutta who happens to be a disciple of the Mahasaya who directs the author to him. He also meets Kanchi Paramcharya who directs him to Ramana Maharishi (when he had no plans whatsoever to visit Arunachalam). According to Ramana Maharishi himself -" Whatever is destined to happen will happen, do what you may to stop it. This is certain. The best course, therefore, is for one to be silent."
Such a deep book definitely requires another read.  </p> 
<li> <b> Farenheit 341 </b> <br> <p> This is a very old Dystopian novel written way back in 1920's but i feel it is quite relevant to the current world situation. This actually reminds me of something during my childhood - Back in late 90's when i was in primary school, I used to frequently visit a nearby club for swimming lessons, after which i used to visit the library in the first floor of the club building for an hour of reading. I remember the library being an enormously busy and huge room, the size of a mini marriage hall with an old librarian wearing thick,round spectacles sitting at the end of the room overseeing the goings on in the room and busily making entries of books borrowed/returned in a log book. There used to be a long oval shaped table with chairs at the centre of the room and as the number of people using the library shot up with time, they also added a few cosy sofas in empty corners of the library to accommodate them.
I was one of those people who used to love picking a book and finding myself a cosy little place on the sofa and enjoy my book. I used to read for an hour or so and used to borrow a book or two and get back home by dinner time.
Due to my parents jobs, we had to shift out of this place for a few years and as luck would have it, they got transferred back to the same place again. So after 10 odd years , i set my foot back into the club (by that time i was pursuing my bachelors) to visit my favourite place - the library. I was expecting it to be renovated and beautified these ten years only to find that room totally empty. No book shelves, the table with chairs, the huge librarian table or my personal favourite sofas. After some enquiry, i learnt that room has been given for some kitty parties and the library has been moved to the ground floor. I was elated that they atleast did not remove the library. So i rushed to the ground floor only to find an extremely small, dingy room for a library. Which has maybe a shelf or two of books, a very small table and some four chairs to sit around which were empty and the good old librarian sitting all alone reading a magazine on a moth-eaten, tiny old wooden table and chair. I dont know why, tears streamed down my eyes by this sight. The glory, the hustle that the old library had was all but lost in oblivion. The librarian (who did recognize me to my surprise) then informed me, they had to shift the library to this small place because there weren't as many visitors anymore barring some old men and the club management felt it was a waste of space to be put up in the huge hall first floor.
For days i was in utter shock and disappointment. The truth is people have completely lost the patience and interest to read books, to let their minds think, to reason. This is what exactly Ray Bradbury imagines in the frightening dystopian setting that he creates for this book. So apt.! One day maybe, this world would turn into the same pathetic, book-hating world that Ray Bradbury so elaborately describes. One day, we might all be just so busy with our lives that we would lose the ability to stop and think, to reason/question, to enjoy the nature around us, stop by to feel the raindrops or lilies or wet mud and we would all just be reduced to machines with no thinking capacity whatsoever.
This book scared me more than any horror novel i have ever read.
One of those classics which everyone MUST read. Ray Bradbury has used such powerful English to convey his thoughts that this book is going to stay in your mind forever.  </p> </li>
